# Here is the explanation
When testing out roll.py and making it print the *roll* variable, the results were the consistant with the rules (I later removed that print statement)
    ex:

`6`
`5`

```
2
You lose!
```

`4`

```
7
You win!
```
I tested every input and it was consistant

However the error displayed says that there is no output where there should be

Thank you in advance
